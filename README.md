## ‚≠ê [Project Overview](#toc)

**The Bash Bits Import Module - The most important and magical part of `Bash-Bits`!**

_**`BB-Import` is THE library you are going to end up using in EVERY Bash script you write from now on!**_

It's obviously a utility which imports external code / libraries into your scripts ... it's HOW BB-Import does it which is special.  Not just for installing `Bash-Bits` modules, you can use `BB-Import` in any of 4 different ways to import ANY script from ANY server on the planet directly into YOUR code!

And that's not even the best bit!  Once `BB-Import` has downloaded that project / repo / script to your local machine, it is cached FOREVER - which means rather than downloading it from the internet every time you want to use your software, BB-Import will download it all once, and from then on will use its locally-cached version unless it's told to go and get a new version.

AND THE NEXT VERSION  WILL EVEN KEEP TRACK OF THE LATEST VERSIONS OF ALL OF YOUR IMPORTS AND RECOMMEND UPDATES!!  That means you're GUARANTEED to always have the very latest available versions of all of your dependencies, FOREVERMORE (or until you decide to stop using Bash-Bits for some reason ... but why would you do that???)

```shell
USAGE EXAMPLES:

#!/usr/bin/env bb::import                   # SHEBANG INSTALL - Modify your system $PATH

source ~/.bb/bb-import.sh                   # SOURCE INSTALL - Simple and effective

bb::import bb-ansi                          # IMPLICIT IMPORT - Official Bash-Bits Modules
bb::import myaccount/myrepo                 # NAMESPACED IMPORT - Formatted GitHub Project
bb::import https://myserver.com/project     # EXPLICIT IMPORT - Custom Download Location
bb::import ../../myfile.sh                  # RELATIVE IMPORT - Local Environment
```

You can even specify specific git branches, tags, or versions to import!

```shell
bb::import bb-ansi@1.1.3
bb::import myaccount/myrepo@mybranch
bb::import https://myserver.com/project@1.2.3
```

> I have to admit that this wasn't my idea.  I've modeled BB-Import after the _INCREDIBLE_ [`importpw/import`](https://github.com/importpw/import) project by Nathan Rajlich, and decided to make a modified version of it a CORE feature of my Bash-Bits project the very moment I laid eyes on it.
> 
> **As always ... I've only been able to do what I do, because I've stood upon the shoulders of giants to do it.**

### [Significant Differences Between BB-Import & `import` by Nathan Rajlich](#toc)

I'll admit, at first glance - especially upon its first release - it might be hard to spot the differences between `BB-Import` and the project that I based it on, `import` by Nathan Rajlich.  So, I'd like to take a moment to draw your attention to the main points of difference.  I'd like to add, the fact that I've done things this way is not at all intended to say that Nathan's solution is _wrong_ or inferior in **ANY** way - I just saw a way it might be done _differently_.

### 1 - No Server

BB-Import does not use a server to resolve the location of resources.

### 2 - Configuration Layer

BB-Import implements a more robust configuration layer.

### 3 - Integrated Logger

BB-Import includes an integrated, but basic logger, to help provide insight into the import process.

### 4 - The Automagic Installer

It is possible to install BB-Import with a single command in your terminal.
 
### [Branch Reliability](#toc)

| Branch               |    Stability    | Code Age         | Reliability |

## üëç [Supporting the Project](#toc)

The creation and maintenance of Open Source Software is definitely a labour of love - this is never going to be a path to riches.  The truth is, it takes not only a lot of time, it creates a substantial amount of personal expense (even when you're working on a shoestring) to keep these projects freely available for all.

If this project is worth something to you, and you're in a position to be able to help out financially, it would <strong>really</strong> take the pressure off here and allow me to keep working and keep it all freely available!

It doesn't have to be a lot, but you will magnify your contribution if you're able to give a little every month.  If you're not in a position to do that, but think you could make a small, one-time donation to the kitty - you'd be AMAZED how I can make a little go a LONG way!

EVERY financial supporter gets their name associated with the project.
