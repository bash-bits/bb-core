# [ðŸ“› BB-Badges](README.md)

If you're using `Bash-Bits` in your project, I'd appreciate it if you'd let people know by displaying a `BB-Badge` on your README and Websites.

Thanks to my handy little [RunKit Endpoint](https://runkit.com/ragdata/bb-badge), `BB-Badges` are as flexible as you expect them to be!  The full compliment of badge styles is available, and you are able to colour your badges any way you like
